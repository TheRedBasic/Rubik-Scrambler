# Rubik-Scrambler
This is something I am working on to help me learn about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS! It only supports the 3x3 but you can use it for a 2x2 (I am going to add more cubes but just don't have the motivation to do it). Hope you learn about this too!


--Operation--
To operate this you must open the index.html file, to scramble your cube you must:
1. Define your cube size (Default is the 3x3)
2. Define your length/amount of turns (The value upon loading is randomized between 10-20)
3. Press Submit!

Once you have your notations, pick your cube's orientation (Be it biological or physical representaion)! Then perform the list of moves. The webpage has a Dark Mode and a Light Mode (Dark Mode is the default) to change the mode press the button underneath the Submit button.

--Clarifacation--
In the bottom left you can see copyright, ignore it, Nathan Comedics Ltd. is a calling sign to let users know that Me (TheRedBasic) is the creator of said program!
